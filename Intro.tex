%                \item   The main point of the paper is to develop an one-gate trojan trigger 
%                circuit. The attack circuitry is on TrustHub. TrustHub has various kinds
%                of attacking circtuits' verilog codes.
%\pause
%                \item   Sheng works on only a small part of the project for developing triggers.
%                He can help us develop the trigger but not the attacking circtuit.
%\pause
%                \item   Leakage power analysis has been applied for detecting trojans that are 
%                off at first and then turned on later. For example, trigger can comes from a
%                counter.
